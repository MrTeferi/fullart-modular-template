# Proxyshop Plugin
A custom template for <a href="https://github.com/MrTeferi/MTG-Proxyshop">Proxyshop</a> similar to the standard Borderless frame, except with a border (mostly). The textbox is also modular, and will expand and shrink based on the length of oracle text.
<br><br>
Side pinlines are my preference, but I added the option to remove those in the config file.
# Install instructions
Drag into the /proxyshop/plugins/ folder, then grab the <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1G3IPgHSy6UD0PbfZmk3-wEJtTcRiYzTF?usp=sharing">.PSD template(s) from my drive</a> and plop it in the /templates/ folder.
